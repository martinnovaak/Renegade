# Renegade chess engine â™ž

Renegade is a chess engine written in C++ using Visual Studio 2019. It values readability and simplicity, and uses the UCI protocol to communicate, making it easy to connect it to chess frontens. Under construction since October 7, 2022.  

The engine is moderately strong, and regularly competes on Lichess over at https://lichess.org/@/RenegadeEngine.

## Features
**Board representation>** Bitboards with a generated lookup table, threefold repetition detection, checkmate and stalemate detection  

**Move generation>** Pseudolegal, attack map generation for legality checking, lookup tables, parallel sliding attack generation  

**Search>** Alpha-beta pruning, iterative deepening, move ordering, principal variation search, quiescence search, transposition table, killer move heuristic, null move pruning, delta pruning, check extensions  

**Evaluation>** Material, piece-square tables, tapered evaluation, tempo bonus, defended pawn bonus, king safety

**Misc>** Communication with UCI protocol, Texel's tuning method, time management, perft, debug commands

## Usage
Renegade - like most chess engines - is a command line application, and it uses the UCI protocol, which is widely supported by chess frontends.
If you are familiar with the protocol, you can also try running it by itself.
