# Renegade chess engine â™ž

Renegade is a chess engine written in C++ using Visual Studio 2019. It values readability and simplicity, and uses the UCI protocol to communicate, making it easy to connect it to chess frontends. Under construction since October 7, 2022 and released publicly on January 15, 2023.  

The engine is moderately strong, and regularly competes on Lichess over at https://lichess.org/@/RenegadeEngine.


## Features
**Board representation >** Bitboards with a generated lookup table, threefold repetition, insufficient material, checkmate and stalemate detection  

**Move generation >** Pseudolegal, attack map generation for legality checking, lookup tables, parallel bitwise sliding attack generation  

**Search >** Alpha-beta pruning, iterative deepening, move ordering, principal variation search, quiescence search, transposition table, killer move heuristic, null move pruning, delta pruning, check extensions  

**Evaluation >** Material, piece-square tables, tapered evaluation, tempo bonus, doubled & tripled pawn penalty, passed pawn bonus, king safety

**Misc >** Communication with UCI protocol, Texel's tuning method, time management, perft, limited opening book support, debug commands


### Known issues & future plans

While Renegade itself is quite good against human players, it has a significantly harder time against other engines. The move generation is quite slow, only achieving about ~4 million nps in perft and 300k during evaluation, and a lot of pruning ideas are also remain to be implemented. To compensate for this, the evaluation function is a bit more thorough. 

The engine is generally stable, and shouldn't make invalid moves or forfeit on time. Some of the issues include the inability to listen for `stop` commands and occasionally outputting incorrect PV lines.


### Build instructions & system requirements

The project can be compiled using Visual Studio 2019 with C++20 features enabled. The engine makes heavy use of `popcnt` and `lzcnt` instructions, thus only processors from 2013 or so are supported, but the calls to these instructions are wrapped in a custom function, and replacing them with something more compatible is relatively straightforward. Currently only Windows binaries are compiled, but in the future I would like to make them for Linux as well.


## Usage
Like most chess engines, this is a command line application implementing the UCI protocol, which is widely supported by graphical chess programs.
If you are familiar with the protocol, you can also try running it by itself.  

Example output:
```
Renegade chess engine 0.7.0 [Jan 15 2023 20:52:03]
go depth 5
info depth 1 seldepth 1 score cp 32 nodes 20 nps 170068 time 0 hashfull 0 pv g1f3
info depth 2 seldepth 2 score cp 18 nodes 59 nps 26823 time 2 hashfull 0 pv g1f3 g8f6
info depth 3 seldepth 3 score cp 32 nodes 523 nps 129870 time 4 hashfull 0 pv g1f3 g8f6 b1c3
info depth 4 seldepth 8 score cp 18 nodes 1354 nps 167069 time 8 hashfull 0 pv g1f3 g8f6 b1c3 b8c6

bestmove g1f3
```

Most UCI commands are supported including limiting search to a specific depth, time limit or node count. Hash size can be configured, and it automatically loads any  `book.bin` opening book it finds in the same folder, but only uses it when `OwnBook` is set to `true`.  

Furthermore, there are some custom commands, including `eval`, `draw` and `fen`. Perft test can be accessed by typing `go perft [n]` or `go perftdiv [n]`.
